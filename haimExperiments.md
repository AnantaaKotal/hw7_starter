## 0. Example topic: the film Double Indemnity

### 0.1 Beginning
Double Indemnity is one of the most influential films ever made.

### 0.1 End
It helped define Film Noir and will remain an important film for years to come.

### 0.1 Result
Double Indemnity is one of the most influential films ever made. Not only is it considered to be the best of the genre, but arguably the best of all time, period. It was the subject of numerous publications and was ranked on many "best of" lists in the early 40's. It was nominated for the Oscars, winning three times. The film's influence has spread through the decades, and it is one of the highest grossing films of all time in the US, has been remade, and is in the process of being a remake. It remains as compelling as ever. The film was made in 1951 and set just years after the 1929 Great Chicago Fire, in a forgotten suburb. It helped define Film Noir and will remain an important film for years to come.

### 0.1 Assessment
The paragraph is reasonable but goes off the rail in sentence seven.  It was not made in 1951 and the Chicago file is completely irrelevant.  Also, it was not a high-grossing film and has not been remade, except as an unimportant made-for-tv movie.  But the first three sentences Haim-added sentences were good, as was the beginning of the fourth added sentence.

### 0.2 Beginning
Double Indemnity is one of the most influential films ever made.

### 0.2 End
It is a dark and depressing film.

### 0.2 Result
Double Indemnity is one of the most influential films ever made. It shows the real side to the character of Tom Corbett. This was no ordinary man. This was a man in the business of taking on the big names, the big money, and the powerful. This was the man that started the Coronet empire and took down Tom Corbett. The film puts us right on the ground where Corbett was when he was killed, as the story unfolds. The film also exposes Tom Corbett's character to his best advantage as he explains himself, and we feel his anger, sadness and struggle. The film features some very beautiful music by John Williams. It is a dark and depressing film.

### 0.2 Assessment
None of the intervening text is relevant to the film.  Tom Corbett is neither the name of an actor or character in the film and john Williams did not do the music. This is a very bad example.

### 0.3 Beginning
Double Indemnity is one of the most influential films ever made.

### 0.3 End
Double Indemnity remains, however, a dark and depressing movie.

### 0.3 Result:
Double Indemnity is one of the most influential films ever made. It's a comedy that's deeply humane and yet has a sense of purpose. It's full of moral ambiguity and philosophical ambiguity, of heartbreak and redemption, of love and violence and friendship. This documentary, made decades later to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release, uses several scenes from Double Indemnity to illustrate its case. The documentary makes a strong case that it was also a feminist film. It tells the story of Margaret Anderson, who played a brilliant woman and one of the first female private investigators in American history. Anderson gets a lot of credit for the development of the private eye, but it's really her. Double Indemnity remains, however, a dark and depressing movie.

### 0.3 Assessment
None of the generated sentences are relevant to this film, unfortunately. Adding the name of the file to the final sentence did not help keep Haim on the topic.

### 0.3 Comments
I suspect that Haim is not good at locking onto a named entity, like **Double Indemnity**, in the initial sentence and recognizing that it is likely to be a good focus for the paragraph.  Perhaps adding a mechanism to recognize and remember named entities would help. Another issue may be the data that it was trained on, which included web pages linked from Reddit.  Training it also on the text from Wikipedia might have helped on this set of examples.  It may also help to have it generate a paragraph that is not expected to be fact-based or even contain any facts, like one that opines on what it means to be a good person.
